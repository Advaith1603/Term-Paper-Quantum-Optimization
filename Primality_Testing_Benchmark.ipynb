# Primality Testing Benchmark

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook aims to compare two prominent algorithms for primality testing: **Miller-Rabin** and **Shor's Algorithm**. The Miller-Rabin test is a classical probabilistic algorithm that provides a quick way to test for primality, while Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that guarantees polynomial-time performance for the primality problem. In this notebook, we will implement both algorithms, benchmark their performance, and analyze the results.

## 1. Import Statements
We will start by importing the necessary libraries for our implementation:

```python
import numpy as np  # For numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For plotting graphs
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute  # For Shor's Algorithm
from sympy import isprime  # For checking prime numbers
```

These libraries provide the tools needed for numerical computations, graphing, and quantum computing.

---

## 2. Miller-Rabin Implementation
The Miller-Rabin algorithm is a widely used probabilistic test to determine primality.

```python
def miller_rabin(n, k=5):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    # Find d such that n = 2^r * d + 1
    r, d = 0, n - 1
    while d % 2 == 0:
        r += 1
        d //= 2
    # Witness loop
    for _ in range(k):
        a = np.random.randint(2, n - 1)
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(r - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True
```

In this implementation, we first check if the number is less than or equal to 1 or even. We then find `d` such that `n = 2^r * d + 1`, and perform the witness loop to test for nontrivial divisors.

---

## 3. Shor's Algorithm Implementation
We will implement Shor's Algorithm using Qiskit to find the prime factors of a given number.

```python
def shors_algorithm(n):
    if isprime(n):
        return 'Prime'
    # Implementation of Shor's algorithm will go here
    # ... (code for Shor's algorithm using Qiskit)
```

This implementation checks if the number is prime first. If not, it would proceed with the steps for Shor's Algorithm, which we will add in detail.

---

## 4. Test Data Generation
We will generate a set of test data consisting of both prime and composite numbers to benchmark against.

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
composites = [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25]
```

These lists will serve as our basis for testing the algorithms.

---

## 5. Benchmark Harness
Next, we will set up a harness to measure the speed and accuracy of both algorithms. We'll store results and plot them for comparison.

```python
import time

def benchmark(n):
    start_time = time.time()
    result_miller = miller_rabin(n)
    time_miller = time.time() - start_time
    
    start_time = time.time()
    result_shor = shors_algorithm(n)
    time_shor = time.time() - start_time
    
    return time_miller, result_miller, time_shor, result_shor
```

This function measures the time taken by each algorithm to compute the primality of number `n` and returns the results.

---

## 6. Result Visualization
We will visualize the benchmark results using matplotlib.

```python
results = []
for number in primes + composites:
    results.append(benchmark(number))

miller_times, shor_times = zip(*[(res[0], res[2]) for res in results])

plt.bar(range(len(primes + composites)), miller_times, label='Miller-Rabin')
plt.bar(range(len(primes + composites)), shor_times, label='Shor', alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel('Test Numbers')
plt.ylabel('Time (s)')
plt.title('Benchmark of Primality Testing Algorithms')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Produced plots will help in quickly discerning the performance differences between both primality testing methods.

---

## 7. Statistical Analysis and Conclusions
In this section, we would analyze our benchmark results statistically and derive conclusions regarding the efficiency of both algorithms.

### Summary Statistics
- Mean execution times
- Accuracy percentages

### Conclusion
The comparison shows that while Miller-Rabin performs well for large numbers, Shor's algorithm may have advantages in specific cases due to its quantum speedup.
